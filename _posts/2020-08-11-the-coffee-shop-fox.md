Here's a recent painting I completed that I thought I'd share on the blog. This is a personal character of mine named Khoury, that I wanted to show running his very own little coffee shop.

<figure class="media"><img src="http://www.staceyjenkins.co.uk/assets/img/uploads/khoury_coffee_shop_blog.png” alt=“A little Arab gentleman peers from behind a coffee shop cashier, surrounded by plants.  A pair of glowing golden fennec ears appear above his head”>

Plus, as a little experiment, I decided to play around with iMovie to make this cute little animation of his fennec ears transitioning in and out.

As the video plays a set of glowing fennec fox ears appear and disappear.</p></figcaption></figure>

I'll post some more artwork soon!
