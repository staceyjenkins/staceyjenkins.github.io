<p>Here&#8217;s a recent painting I completed that I thought I&#8217;d share on the blog. This is a personal character of mine named Khoury, that I wanted to show running his very own little coffee shop.</p>

<p>Plus, as a little experiment, I decided to play around with iMovie to make this cute little animation of his fennec ears transitioning in and out.</p>

As the video plays a set of glowing fennec fox ears appear and disappear.</p> </figcaption> </figure>

<p>I&#8217;ll post some more artwork soon! In the meantime, please feel free to <a href="http://www.instagram.com/froginajar">follow me on Instagram</a> for my latest sketches and work in progress shots.</p>
