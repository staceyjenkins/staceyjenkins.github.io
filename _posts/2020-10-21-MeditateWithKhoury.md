I like to listen to lofi hiphop or jazzhop while I work, and I got inspired to replicate my own version of the infamous [Chillhop](https://chillhop.com/) racoon animation.

As part of a little experiment, I animated my lovable fox child Khoury meditating, and created a playlist for him on its own dedicated page on this website!

<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="[https://www.youtube.com/embed/](https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cYal_hitz4 "https://www.youtube.com/embed/0cYal_hitz4")AOTRAlzlIkA" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

I animated this little clip of Khoury slowly moving his ears in Procreate, before transferring to Clip Studio Paint to paint each frame. The file was then moved back into Procreate before exporting as a video file.
