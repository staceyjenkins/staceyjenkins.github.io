title: Announcing the brand-new staceyjenkins.co.uk!

---
Hello and welcome to the brand new staceyjenkins.co.uk!

<h3>So why the change?</h3>

The existing staceyjenkins.co.uk site had been in its current state since late 2016. This new site has been an incredibly involved and very ambitious project on my part, including  coding a brand-new blog functionality into my site from scratch! 

Well, not exactly. This new site has been built from the ground up with[ the static site generator Jekyll ](https://jekyllrb.com/)boosted up with the absolutely fantastic [Forestry.io ](https://forestry.io/)doing a lot of the heavy-lifting.

I'm super excited about this new site and taking a new leap under the alias _froginajar_.  I'm even more excited to show you what I've got in the pipeline.

Here's to new leaps forward!
