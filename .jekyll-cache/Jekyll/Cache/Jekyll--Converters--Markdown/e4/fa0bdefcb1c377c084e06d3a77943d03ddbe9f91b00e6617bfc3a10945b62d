I"A<p>Hello and welcome to the brand new staceyjenkins.co.uk!</p>

<h3>So why the change?</h3>

<p>The existing staceyjenkins.co.uk site had been in its current state since late 2016. This new site has been an incredibly involved and very ambitious project on my part, including  coding a brand-new blog functionality into my site from scratch!</p>

<p>Well, not exactly. This new site has been built from the ground up with<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"> the static site generator Jekyll </a>boosted up with the absolutely fantastic <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry.io </a>doing a lot of the heavy-lifting.</p>

<p>I’m super excited about this new site and taking a new leap under the alias <em>froginajar</em>.  I’m even more excited to show you what I’ve got in the pipeline.</p>

<p>Here’s to new leaps forward!</p>
