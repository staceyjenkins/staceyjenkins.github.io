I"h<p>Back in early 2014, I worte a blogpost on my site called ‘Drawing Humans’. Naturally, the annals of time ensured that that blogpost went wherever pages go when they 404. Thankfully, while going through my earlier archives, I found an early draft of it which I will now restore to its rightful place back on the blog. Now as time has ticked on, I have since gathered other resources and useful stuff to share on this topic, but hopefully this post will give you a better idea on how to construct the figure by its proportions and I will share some of my own discoveries that may help you achieve the same!</p>
