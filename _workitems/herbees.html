<h3>The Brief</h3>
<p>Herbees is a food retail business aiming to change the perception of service station food. Run by foody friends Jack and John Wright, Herbees serves healthy, well-sourced honey-based cuisine and vegetarian options available to takeaway, such as honey-roast chicken burgers, honey granola and Greek lemon yoghurt and Moroccan falafels. The company's specialisation in honey is also reflected in its name - all the honey used in each brand across the UK can be sourced to their own apiary. Herbees also offers lots of breakfast options, vegan options and gluten-free options too, something that John feels very passionate about. The lack of dietary options at service stations is severely lacking, making Herbees an innovative new player in the market. They believe that good, healthy and fun food shouldn't be hard to find and a second thought, especially when you travel.</p>

<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>Herbees is inspired after Jack and John's love of travelling and the Herbie films of the early 60s. They adore the slick styling of the classic VW Beetle as well as the film's quirky sense of humour and love affair with the car. As a result, the brand identity is a fun take on motoring and racing iconography, containing references to the films such as 'Thorndyke's Tea and Toast' and the 'No. 53 Burger'.</p>
