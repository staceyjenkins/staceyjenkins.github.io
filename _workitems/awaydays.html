A playful but professional interactive quiz for managers to choose the best away days</p>
<h3>The Brief</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.unum.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unum</a> are a company with the employee in mind. They vouch for protecting the employee and help businesses to introduce benefits for their staff. Initially pitched as a static flowchart infographic, I managed the strategy, design and development of an interactive quiz as an evergreen promotional tool and light-hearted way for businessowners decide on the best away day for their staff.</p>

<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>As well as defining the overall look of the site and developing the operation of the quiz, I managed the UI and UX along with creating the icons for each of the away daysâ€™ result pages.</p>

<figure class="media"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/work/awayday_2.png" alt="Each question included within the quiz covered a particular aspect of away days, including whether the away day was for physical activity, or a relaxing one."/>
