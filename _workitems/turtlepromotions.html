<p class="intro">A quirky logo design and brand language for a music promoter in South Wales</p>
<h4>The Brief</h4>
<p>Lucy Turtle is a music promoter based in the Swansea and South West Wales area. Originally I was hired to create regular music posters for various unsigned indie and alternative bands across the area. A little later on, I was asked to modernise and update the brand to attract a new audience to band performances.</p>
<h4>The Logo Strategy</h4>

<p>The new logomark needed to reflect both a quirky, fun attitude but also the music loving nature of the business. As well as this, the new mark had to be used as an entry stamp to prove gig attendees had purchased tickets. </p>

<p>Custom poster designs were commissioned for each gig that the client was promoting, all performed by artists in venues around the Llanelli, Swansea and Port Talbot areas. In a very competitive market, these posters needed to be highly visual and eye-catching, cheap and easy for the client to print while also expressing the indie feel of the artists that Turtle Promotions supported. </p>
