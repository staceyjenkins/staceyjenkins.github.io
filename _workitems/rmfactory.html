<p class="intro">A hand-crafted promotional direct mail created to promote RM Education’s range of laptops for primary and secondary schools.</p>

<h4>The Brief</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.rm.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RM Education</a> hold an interesting position in the market with their own unique set of laptops and computers, specifically designed for use within a fast-paced, high impact school environment. As a junior in-house designer working within the small scale design team, I was asked to create a concept for a unique direct-mail to promote these hand-wearing laptops to primary schools and secondary schools nationwide across the UK.</p>
<h4>The Strategy</h4>

<p>Every laptop in RM Education's range is specialised for a specific use, much like someone having their own favourite  chocolate in a chocolate box. Therefore, I originally pitched the concept of a chocolate box as a direct mail idea, with each individual chocolate being representative of the range. Although this was a much larger scale than the client intended, the final concept was still based around a chocolate bar, and that each laptop was hand-crafted, much like an artisan chocolate. I designed and illustrated the entire interior contents of the mail-out, including the brochure and chocolate bar packaging design.</p>
<p>The project in total returned a 20:1 on investment.</p>
