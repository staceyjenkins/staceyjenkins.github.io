<p class="intro">A online data visualisation documenting internet freedoms around the world</p>
<h3>The Brief</h3>
<p>In a dangerous world where internet censorship is becoming more and more commonplace, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ivpn.net/" rel="nofollow">IVPN</a> offers greater internet freedom and accessibility on almost any consumer available device. However, not everywhere has that accessibility. As a way of promotiong their services, IVPN requested an online, interactive data visualisation displaying all internet accessibility across the world in a simple to understand format.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>

<p>The final site is expansive and information packed, with each country being clickable to show more information. Alongside an interactive map, expansive lists were also provided, revealing the top countries with the most restrictions. </p>

<figure class="media"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/work/censorship_3.png" alt=" The site also provides insightful tables of data based how many user rights violations the country has committed, the top obstacles for access and which countries limit the most content. "/>
