<p class="intro">A quirky online calculator and health guide for a luxurious travel advice website</p>
<h3>The Brief</h3>
<p>Although being based in the Isle of Man, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flytodubai.co.uk/">Fly to Dubai </a>aims to promote the best of the Arabian city and for the best price. As part of a promotional online campaign based around healthy living and good eating, they requested an online ever-green calculator helping users to work out the levels of caffeine they consume daily, and help them realise the danger levels of excessive caffeine consumption.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<figure class="media"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/work/caffeine_2.jpeg" alt="An initial breakdown of the questionnaire was first established, starting with specific restrictions for gender then moving on to coffee, tea and other drink screens. Illustrations were then drawn by hand and then fleshed out for the final screens."/>

        An initial breakdown of the questionnaire was first established, starting with specific restrictions for gender then moving on to coffee, tea and other drink screens. Illustrations were then drawn by hand and then fleshed out for the final screens. </p>

<p>Each section needed to researched thoroughly so that each drink and its caffeine level could be used and calculated accurately. At the same time, the complete design and illustration style of the calculator needed to fit within the predefined design guidelines and platform of the site.</p>


<figure class="media"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/work/caffeine_3.jpeg" alt="Based on the questions answered, the site would then reveal the final recommended away day, a short description and a direct link to find out more about booking the away day. "/>
  <figcaption>
        <p>Breaking down each section into its own individual screen allowed development of the site to move smoothly, and made calculating the final result much easier. For example, as shown here, if the user is female, the site needed to account for whether or not they were pregnant. </p>

    <p>On each screen, individual drinks and items could be added according to what brand name coffee shop they were bought at,  the size of the drink and in the case of tea-based drinks, their brew strength. </p>
