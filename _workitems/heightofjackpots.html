 <p class="intro">A fun interactive visualisation describing the scale of lottery prizes</p>
              <h3>The Brief</h3>
              <p>Based in Gibraltar, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lottoland.co.uk/">Lottoland </a> is a one-stop site helping lottery players to buy tickets and check up on the results from several different games in one place, including Thunderball, The National Lottery, Euromillions and several games from outside the UK, including the Spanish El Gordo and Irish Lotto games. As part of a promotional campaign to attract more traffic to the site, the client wanted to display the scale of the EuroMillions jackpot in a fun yet informative way that also worked well with the cheerful and friendly Lottoland brand. </p>
             


            
              <h3>The Strategy</h3>
              <p>Working alongside an SEO consultant, I designed and illustrated a proposal for an online interactive website where coins would pile up against several worldwide landmarks and events. As well as designing and illustrating all artwork on the site, I also developed the site and produced all interactive animations while scrolling.   </p>

<figure class="media"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/work/jackpots_1.png" alt=" The final site displayed a set of pound coins that would pile up and reach various milestones as the user scrolled their way to the eventual EuroMillions jackpot. "/>
