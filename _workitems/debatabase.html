<p class="intro">An expansive and extensive mini-site, celebrating the best of the silver screen.</p>
<h3>The Brief</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.morphsuits.co.uk/">Morph Suits</a> is a fancy dress retailer based in the heart of Edinburgh, specialising in the production of full body fancy dress costumes for a wide range of characters and themes from movies and pop culture. As part of a promotional marketing campaign based around the Baftas and Oscars ceremonies for 2016, a encyclopedic-style mini site was proposed, showing the company's true love of film. The site aimed to show the best actors and actresses over the 50 years based on the amount of Oscar and/or Bafta awards they had won throughout their career.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>

<figure class="media"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/work/debatabase_2.jpeg" alt="The site was designed with two specfic sections in mind - the full list of actors, an individual actor page with a third section designed to be a pop-up window that activated on each entry in the graph."/>

<p>Clicking on the individual actor then displayed a graph, which showed the filomography of the actor based on that film's Rotten Tomatoes rating and which films earned the actor a Bafta and/or Oscar respectively. The graph itself was one of the trickiest aspects of the site to implement, but was an essential part of giving the entire site its effectiveness.</p>
