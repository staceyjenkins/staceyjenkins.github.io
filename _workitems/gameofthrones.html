<h3>The Brief</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.1staerials.co.uk/">1st Aerials </a> are a small TV installations company based in the heart of Berkshire, specialising in the installation of Sky and digital television services in the area. Although the site was intially briefed as much more extensive site containing information of similar series such as 'Breaking Bad' and 'Better Call Saul' amongst others, my client felt that this was considerably too large for their site to handle. Therefore the brief was readjusted to connect with the release of Season 5 of HBO's hit series 'Game of Thrones'.</p>

<h3>The Strategy</h3>

<p>Although the final site looks relatively simple, this was a challenging but incredibly fun project, in which a great deal of logical thinking was required. The length of each episode needed to be researched and stored as data for the site. The code had to both calculate the total time according to user input, but at the same time, display the amount of time left that the user had to watch. This information also needed to easily translatable into years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds! As a result, the site gained considerable attention on social media, giving the client the needed promotional boost the initial brief required. So successful in fact, that the site was later updated to cover the following season when it was announced, making it a very useful tool for new fans and existing fans alike. </p>
