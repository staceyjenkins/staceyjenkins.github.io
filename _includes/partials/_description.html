         <p>Hello! I'm Stacey! I’m a digital designer and illustrator from South Wales.</p> 

<p>Over the past nine years, I have helped people leap ahead by solving their creative problems and helped create fantastic content for fantastic people, pencil to pixel.</p>

<p>Every element from image, type and even sound and music, is paramount. But if I’m not pushing pencils or pixels, I’m playing D&amp;D or writing adventures under the alias froginajar.</p>
